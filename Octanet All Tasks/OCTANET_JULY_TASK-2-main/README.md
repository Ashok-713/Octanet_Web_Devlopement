 Octanet Company Internship
 # Task 2
Here is Task 2 of my virtual internship with OctaNet community as a Web Developer Intern .

A to-do list project is a web application or web-based system that allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks and responsibilities in a structured and efficient manner. It serves as a digital tool for individuals or teams to keep track of their ongoing tasks, set priorities, and ensure timely completion of activities.
